# b-tree - Disk-backed B* trees

`b-tree` is a Haskell implementation of a disk-backed B* tree. The
library uses streaming IO to write an immutable B-tree to disk from
ordered keys. This tree can then be opened via mmap for lookups. The
tree can also be iterated over as well as merged with other trees and
leaf sources.
